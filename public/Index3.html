            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Iâ€™m enjoy programming both as a career and as something I do in my spare time to continually improve and build on my skillset. My favourite technologies include Javascript, Node and ASP.NET.

                During my career I have proven myself to be an adept problem solver; producing quality results in minimal time. There have been many times where I have brought an issue to the attention of an architect or business analyst, then devised and clearly described a straightforward practical solution.

                As a software developer, I have worked successfully in team environments. As a result many of the people I work with come to see me as an intelligent, approachable person and often come to me first when seeking help or guidance.
